Medim priority:
- Document all the tunables

- Improvements to hogl-recover tool
  o Use mmap() instead of reading entire corefile
  o Support for loading shared libraries

- Update to C++11

----
Low priority:
- Improve C-API performance

- Engine should use condition variable instead of a simple sleep.
  This would allow app threads to wake up the engine if needed.

----
Ideas:
- Consider using area id instead of the pointer
  Requires safe and fast access for mapping id back to pointer.

- Separate output file per ring (as an option)

- Consider supporting something like this 
  hogl::stream(my_area, my_section) hs;
  hs << "blah blah" << "more blah" << hogl::eol;
